Claude Monet was a pivotal French painter and a leading figure in the Impressionist movement. Renowned for his mastery in capturing the transient effects of light and color, Monet's works are characterized by their vibrant hues and loose brushwork. He often painted the same scene multiple times to capture varying light conditions, as seen in his series of water lilies, haystacks, and the Rouen Cathedral. His dedication to plein air painting and his innovative approach significantly influenced the development of modern art, making him one of the most celebrated artists of the 19th and early 20th centuries.
