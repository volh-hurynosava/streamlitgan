**Ukiyo-e - genre of Japanese art**

**Famous Works:** The Great Wave, Irises, White and Red Plum Blossoms

Ukiyo-e, meaning "pictures of the floating world," is a genre of Japanese art that flourished from the 17th to the 19th centuries. These woodblock prints and paintings depict scenes of urban life, including kabuki actors, sumo wrestlers, beautiful courtesans, and landscapes. Artists like Hokusai and Hiroshige became renowned for their work in this style, producing iconic images such as "The Great Wave off Kanagawa" and "The Fifty-three Stations of the Tōkaidō." Ukiyo-e art is characterized by its bold lines, vibrant colors, and emphasis on everyday life, capturing both the ephemeral beauty and the dynamic culture of Edo-period Japan. This art form greatly influenced Western artists, contributing to the Japonisme movement in Europe and shaping modern art's development.
